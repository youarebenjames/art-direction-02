        <h1>String theory</h1>
                <p class="introduction">In physics, string theory is a mathematical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings.</p>
        <p>String theory aims to explain all types of observed elementary particles using quantum states of these strings. In addition to the particles postulated by the standard model of particle physics, string theory incorporates gravity and so is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Besides this potential role, string theory is now widely used as a theoretical tool and has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory and quantum gravity.</p>

<p class="sub-intro">The earliest version of string theory, bosonic string theory, incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons.</p> <p>It was then developed into superstring theory, which posits that a connection – a "supersymmetry" – exists between bosons and the class of particles called fermions. To retain its mathematical consistency, string theory requires the existence of extra spatial dimensions; in the physical models constructed to date, these extra dimensions are typically compactified to extremely small scales.</p>

<h2>String theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the strong nuclear force before being abandoned in favor of the theory of quantum chromodynamics.</h2> Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. Five consistent versions of string theory were developed until it was realized in the mid-1990s that they were different limits of a conjectured single 11-dimensional theory now known as M-theory.

<p class="sub-intro">Many theoretical physicists, including Stephen Hawking, Edward Witten and Juan Maldacena, believe that string theory is a step towards the correct fundamental description of nature:</p>Pit accommodates a consistent combination of quantum field theory and general relativity, agrees with insights in quantum gravity (such as the holographic principle and black hole thermodynamics) and has passed many non-trivial checks of its internal consistency. <h4>According to Hawking</h4> <blockquote>"M-theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe."</blockquote> Other physicists, such as Richard Feynman, Roger Penrose and Sheldon Lee Glashow, have criticized string theory for not providing novel experimental predictions at accessible energy scales.
